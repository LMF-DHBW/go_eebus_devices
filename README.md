This repository includes the device specific code that uses a framework of the EEBUS protocol in the Go programming language.
The EEBUS protocol suite provides high-quality protocols, which allow efficient communication of smart home IoT devices, independent of device brand, type and other factors.
It provides an open-source, future-proof solution that can be applied in many environments and for numerous applications.

## About
This framework is part of a student research project at DHBW Stuttgart and provides a partial implementation of the EEBUS protocols SHIP and SPINE.

The documentation of the student research project can be found here:
